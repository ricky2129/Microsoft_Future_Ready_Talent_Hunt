<b> Problem Statement/ Opportunity : </b> 
Many online shoppers struggle to find a reliable and user-friendly platform to purchase baggage and luggage products. The existing online stores often lack intuitive navigation, comprehensive product information, and trustworthy customer reviews, resulting in a frustrating and uncertain shopping experience. Therefore, there is a need for an easy and simple online store for baggage that addresses these issues, ensuring a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience for customers.

<b> Project Description : </b>
The core idea of our project is to solve the problem of a lack of user-friendly and reliable online platforms for purchasing baggage and luggage products.
By providing a well-organized online store with easy-to-use features, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction and eliminate the frustrations associated with purchasing luggage products online.

<b> Primary Azure Technology/Cloud services : </b>
* Azure Static Web Apps-
  It is a fully managed service designed specifically for hosting static web applications. It simplifies the process of building and deploying static websites and enables developers to focus on their code rather than infrastructure management.
* Azure CDN-
  It is a service that helps deliver content, such as images, videos, and static files, to end-users with improved performance and scalability. It caches content at edge locations worldwide, reducing latency and improving load times by serving content from the nearest server to the user's location.
* Azure Front Door-
  It is a global, scalable entry point for web applications and APIs. It optimizes and secures the delivery of web content by intelligently routing user requests to the nearest available backend service.

  By combining these services, you create a setup where your static web app is efficiently deployed, its content is delivered quickly to users globally through caching and CDN, and Azure Front Door further optimizes routing to ensure users have a smooth and responsive experience.

<b> Features : </b>
- Deployment of the web application using Azure Static Web Apps
- Accelerated content delivery and caching through Azure CDN
- Global routing, load balancing, and SSL termination with Azure Front Door
- Performance optimization for static assets
- Improved user experience with reduced latency and faster page load times
